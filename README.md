## About

An app designed to track and organize tasks. Let me paint a picture for you to explain why I created this app.

> You're at the grocery store, done shopping, and headed to the front of the store. You happen to cut through the aisle with all the greeting cards. Seeing them, you suddenly remember that you need to write a thank you letter to your grandma for that lovely birthday present... uh, three months ago. You keep forgetting!

If you're a forgetful person like me, this sort of scenario can happen several times a day. Notes and reminders help, and sometimes I can keep up a pretty good habit of making myself to-do lists, but nothing works consistently.

What I needed was something that fulfilled these primary requirements:

1. Quickly and easily jot down a note about something I need to do.
2. Keep track of things I need to do, but that don't have a specific due date.
3. Automatically provide me a list of suggested tasks for the day.

## Task Types

Each task type

### Draft Tasks

Tasks that have been 'jotted down'. They are represented by one line of text, and can be expanded into a more complex task at a later time.

### Flexible Tasks

Tasks that are not time-sensitive, but need to be done eventually.
Examples:

-   Research about something you want to buy at some point.
-   Fixing something around the house.

### Deadline Tasks

Tasks that need to be done by a certain date.
Examples:

-   Paying a bill before it's due.
-   ...

### Scheduled Tasks

Tasks that need to be done on a certain date.
Examples:

-   Meetings
-   Appointments
-   Scheduled errands

### Repeating Tasks _(not yet implemented)_

Tasks that are done at a regular interval.
Examples:

-   Putting out trash bins for collection on a certain day of the week.
-   Checking your car's oil every x months.
-   Paying rent every month.

## Features to be added:

-   Repeating Tasks
-   Button to assign additional tasks for the day
-   Task requirements (must complete one task before another)
-   "Expand Tasks" - Automatic task shown on to do list if there are any draft tasks
-   An optional model for longer tasks that need to be worked on for several days (checking complete would mean that you worked on it for the day)
-   Full date picker implementation.
-   Work vs Non-work tasks
