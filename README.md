## About

Task Traffic Control is a Task-Tracking App for Android.

It's designed to help you keep track of all the things that you need to do, both big and small. It's easy to get overwhelmed with all the things you have to do. Often times the small tasks end up getting pushed aside by more important tasks, and therefore never done and eventually forgotten about. This app aims to solve that problem with these core features:

1. **Task Capture**: Quickly and easily input tasks before you forget about them.
2. **Tracking**: Keep track all of your tasks in one centralized place.
3. **Suggestions**: Provides you with a daily list of suggested tasks, scaled to fit your free time for the day.
